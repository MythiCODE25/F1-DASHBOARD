# F1 Dashboard

## Project Overview
The **F1 Dashboard** is a web application built using React that displays Formula 1 data such as Driver Standings (WDC) and Constructor Standings (WCC).

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate:
- API integration using `fetch`
- Data manipulation using JavaScript array methods
- Clean and responsive UI development
- Implementation of performance-enhancing features

This project is developed as part of an academic assignment to showcase practical frontend development skills.
